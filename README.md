# Memory Game

Javascript memory game, built with HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
The game has 4 modes:
* Easy - this is a standard memory game with 16 tiles
* Hard - this is a 36 tile memory game with some images that are similar to test observation
* Ninja - this is a 36 tile memory game but also has images on the front side of the cards to really test your skills
* Mayhem - this mode will frustrate the hell out of you. It is the same as ninja mode but the tiles re-arrange every 30 seconds
